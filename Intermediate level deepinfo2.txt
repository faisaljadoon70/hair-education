1. 10 Volume: No lift, deposit only (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

10 volume developer is the lowest strength developer used in hair coloring, and it is characterized by its inability to provide lift to the existing hair color. It is primarily used for depositing color only, and it is designed to be used when you need to add pigment or tone, without altering the existing base color of the hair. It’s a very gentle chemical product and causes the least amount of damage to the hair shaft, making it the best choice for color balancing and color refresh. This developer is often used when you want to enhance the existing tone of the hair, add a gloss, or to match the color of the roots, while creating the least amount of damage or lifting to the rest of the hair. Understanding its specific properties is key for stylists to avoid unwanted lift or damage when applying hair color. Now, let’s expand on that: 10 volume developer has the lowest concentration of hydrogen peroxide, which is the active agent that causes lift and oxidation in the hair, and that is why it is only used for deposit, and will not lift or lighten existing color. It causes the cuticle to expand slightly, allowing the color molecules to enter the cortex layer of the hair, but it does not cause a chemical reaction that is strong enough to lift or alter the underlying pigment. Because of its low strength, it is a safer option than other higher volume developers, especially when working with previously processed or delicate hair. The use of 10 volume is ideal when your goal is not to change the level of the hair, but rather to add a new tone, or to enhance the existing color. It also gives you more freedom in creating creative looks as it does not change or affect the base color, and provides a consistent and predictable end result. Stylists need to know that it will not provide any lift or lightening, so this is not the correct option when you are trying to lighten a color and change the hair from a level to another. Therefore, you must use other methods and higher volume developers to achieve those goals, and to understand the different ways that those chemicals impact the hair structure. Also remember that 10 volume developers should be used only in those situations where there is no need to lift, and that they should not be chosen when you need to lift more than a single level. So make sure you choose your developer wisely, and to always create a detailed plan before beginning your work!

2. 20 Volume: 1-2 levels of lift (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

20 volume developer is a medium-strength developer that is known for its ability to lift the natural hair color by 1 to 2 levels, while also providing sufficient deposit of color and tone. This type of developer has a good balance of lifting power and color absorption, making it a versatile choice for many common hair coloring techniques and it is often used for standard coloring procedures. It is also one of the most commonly used developers as it is able to provide enough lift to adjust the natural tone of hair, while also offering sufficient absorption of the new color pigment that you are applying to the hair shaft. This allows for a wide range of techniques that can be employed while also minimizing the risk of damage or over processing, and provides the most predictable outcome, making it one of the most reliable developers on the market. As stylists you must master this developer to provide a quality result and to use its unique benefits to the full potential. Now, let's explore the details: 20 volume developer contains a moderate amount of hydrogen peroxide, and that is what causes a mild level of lifting when it is combined with hair dye or lightener. It is designed to open the cuticle and partially lift the underlying pigment, while also depositing new pigment molecules, and giving you both a lift and a tone at the same time. It is able to achieve a controlled level of lift, which allows you to lift the hair while maintaining the structural integrity of the hair, but you must still be mindful of its potential side-effects. The use of 20 volume developer is ideal when you need to create a subtle change in hair color, and want to lift one to two levels and add a tone at the same time. It is also the ideal choice when you need a balanced approach for both lift and deposit. Stylists must master the use of 20 volume to achieve a very wide variety of results and also to deliver very subtle changes that are natural and beautiful. You will also need to understand the way that it interacts with different types of hair, and always be ready to adjust your timings according to the texture and the state of the hair. Therefore, using 20 volume developer requires a mix of understanding the science and the art of hair coloring, and you must continue your education to master all of its possibilities. Also remember that you will need to use different developer strengths based on your needs, and understanding the differences between each option is what will make you a better and more skilled stylist.

3. 30 Volume: 2-3 levels of lift (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

30 volume developer is a high-strength developer designed to provide a more significant lift to the natural hair color, typically ranging from 2 to 3 levels, while it still has the ability to deposit color. This means that it is a more aggressive option and it is often used when you need to create more dramatic changes to the hair color, while still trying to maintain a balance between the two procedures. It also requires more caution and understanding of the effects of the chemicals, as it has a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide, making it a much more potent product than 10 and 20 volume. This volume of developer is usually used for medium to high levels of lifting, or when you need a color with higher saturation and it allows stylists to work with more creative freedom, while also being mindful of the risks involved in using higher concentrations of chemicals. You will often see that 30 volume is used for highlights, balayage, and other coloring techniques that require a good amount of lift and change to the existing hair tone. Now, let's go into more detail: the increased strength of the 30 volume developer means that it creates a stronger chemical reaction with the melanin in your hair, that is what causes it to lift 2-3 levels, and to prepare the hair shaft for the new color. This higher concentration of chemicals makes it a great option when you want to create more obvious results, but it also means that you need to be much more cautious about the overall health of the hair. Because the chemicals are more potent, you must always pay close attention to the timings of your treatments to prevent over processing, damage or an unwanted final result, and it is very important to take into account the hair texture and porosity of your client, so that you can customize a plan that makes sense for their hair needs. Also, remember that you need to use a variety of different techniques and also to be able to select the correct products, to help you create a more reliable and predictable result.

4. 40 Volume: 3-4 levels of lift (use with caution) (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

40 volume developer is the highest-strength developer that is typically used in hair coloring, and it is characterized by its ability to achieve a significant lift in the natural hair color, typically between 3 and 4 levels. Due to its powerful nature, it should always be used with extreme caution, and only when you need to achieve a very high degree of lift or when you want to do a large change of hair color that requires multiple steps. The high concentration of hydrogen peroxide makes it a very potent chemical, and that is why it needs a lot of care and precision when used. This option is best for situations where you have a very strong and healthy hair structure that is able to withstand this type of aggressive treatment, and even then, you must always assess and prepare the hair to reduce the potential for long term damage. From a stylist’s perspective, understanding the properties of 40 volume is paramount, as you need to know when to use it, when to avoid it, and also what type of pre-treatments you need to use. Now let's delve into the details: 40 volume developers contain the highest level of hydrogen peroxide and they create a very strong chemical reaction, which lifts the natural color by multiple levels, making it the best option when you are trying to lift very dark hair, or when you are going for an extremely light shade. Because of its potency, it can easily cause damage to the hair shaft and you should always choose high-quality products that are designed to protect and nourish the hair as they are lifting the pigment. You must always assess the client’s hair porosity and structure before you are choosing this high strength developer, and only make the choice if the hair can withstand the procedure. When you are using 40 volume, you must also be mindful of the processing time, and pay very close attention to how the chemical reaction is progressing, so you can stop the lift once you have reached the desired result. Also remember that after your lift you need to make sure to use toners and nourishing products, to help balance the tone, and to protect the cuticle of the hair from further damage. Stylists who master the use of 40 volume developer, must also master the art of damage control and be ready with a list of repair products to make sure the hair structure is not compromised long term. Also understanding that this type of developer can be too much for some types of hair is very important, and you should always have a responsible mindset when you are choosing to work with higher volume developers. Therefore, using 40 volume is a sign that you understand all of the best techniques, and all of the best practices, and that you have the experience to produce amazing results, but remember that you must always take responsibility for the health and well being of your clients, above all else.

5. Always wear protective gloves (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

Always wearing protective gloves is a critical safety practice for hairstylists and an important habit for anyone working with hair chemicals, as it provides a barrier against skin irritation, chemical burns, and unwanted staining from hair dyes and other products. Protective gloves are an essential part of any personal protection equipment, and should be used anytime you are handling products, and chemicals, to make sure that you are preventing all risks and ensuring your safety and your clients safety. It is a basic step that all professionals should always adhere to, and it is a must for any safe practices in hair coloring and chemical treatments. It is also important to choose the correct type of gloves and to change them frequently, to make sure that they are always providing the right amount of protection. Now, let’s dive deeper into this important habit: Using protective gloves is not just a suggestion; it's a foundational requirement to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. The chemicals that you use on hair, such as hair dyes, bleaches, and perming solutions, can often be very harsh on the skin, and they can easily lead to dryness, irritation, allergic reactions, and even burns. When you are using protective gloves, you are protecting yourself, and also your clients. The gloves act as an impermeable barrier that prevents those chemicals from making direct contact with the skin, minimizing potential side effects. It is also important to pay close attention to the material of the glove, and to always choose options that are resistant to the harsh chemicals, and that you replace those gloves frequently if they have come into contact with any chemical products. Also, because prolonged exposure to hair dyes and chemicals can also cause long term health issues, such as dermatitis, skin discoloration, and even more serious problems, a reliable protection plan is essential. For stylists, wearing protective gloves also helps maintain a clean and hygienic environment, preventing cross contamination and the spread of any type of bacteria and infection. It will also prevent your own hands from getting stained with any hair dyes and other chemical products. In conclusion, remember that wearing gloves is a commitment to the highest professional and ethical standards, and is a sign that you value the health and well-being of yourself and all of your clients, so always make sure to put them on, before starting any process that might involve working with a new product or chemical.

6. Work in well-ventilated areas (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

Working in well-ventilated areas is a fundamental safety practice in the hairdressing profession, and it is a must for all types of practices that require the use of chemicals, and especially those that involve coloring, bleaching, perming, and straightening as it is all designed to minimize the risk of inhaling dangerous fumes, and chemicals, and helps you maintain a healthy and breathable environment for everyone. Proper ventilation is not only essential for the well-being of the stylist, but it also protects the clients from breathing in fumes and chemicals that may have negative effects on their bodies. When you are working in a salon, and you are using all of the chemical products that are required for your practice, a reliable ventilation system is an absolute must to maintain the best possible air quality. Let’s explore that further: Many hair coloring products, as well as other chemical treatments, release volatile compounds and fumes that, when inhaled, can cause a variety of health issues, which range from mild and temporary irritation, to more serious and long-term respiratory issues. These fumes can also cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and other issues, especially when you are exposed to these types of chemicals for long periods of time. Also remember, that a poorly ventilated room also means that these chemical components remain airborne, making it more difficult to work, as the air is constantly full of those particles. When you work in a space with good ventilation, that ensures that fumes are properly dispersed and removed from the air, and by creating a healthy environment for everyone, you are also protecting your own body from long term exposure. As a stylist, by working in a well ventilated environment, you are reducing the risk of short and long term health effects and also you are improving the overall experience for all of your clients. The clients are also more comfortable when they are not inhaling those fumes, and that is important for creating an enjoyable experience. Also, keep in mind, that it is not only about you and your clients, but it is also about creating a professional and healthy space where you and others can work. Always remember, that by choosing a well ventilated space, you are also choosing to be responsible for the well being of everyone you work with, and that is a very important step in becoming a great and responsible professional stylist.

7. Perform patch tests 24-48 hours before (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

Performing patch tests 24 to 48 hours before any chemical treatment is a crucial safety step for all stylists, and for all clients that are about to undergo any procedures that involve chemicals, and it is also a necessary step to make sure you are prepared for any potential allergic reactions or sensitivity that a client might have. It is an important safety precaution that helps identify a sensitivity, or an allergy to the chemical components that are present in hair color and other hair treatment products. By performing a simple patch test, you will be able to identify a problem in advance, and also to prevent severe allergic reactions and negative side effects to your client’s skin or scalp. This also provides an opportunity for you to properly manage the reaction and to know what steps to take if there are any issues, and this shows that you care for the well being and safety of your clients. Let’s look at all the details of why this is so important: A patch test involves applying a very small amount of the product onto a small area of the skin, typically behind the ear or on the inside of the elbow, to check if there is any type of skin irritation, or sensitivity. This test will help you to understand how your client’s skin will respond to that product, and will make you prepared to handle a potential negative response to the application of chemical components. Many people have undiagnosed allergies and sensitivities, that they are not aware of, so having a patch test is the most reliable method of making sure you avoid any potential issues, and to minimize any possible damage to the health and well being of your clients. These reactions can be as mild as skin itching, and more severe reactions might include swelling, blisters, and other types of discomfort, which you must help your client avoid at all costs. From a stylist’s point of view, it is critical to understand that you are not only there to make people look beautiful, but also to make sure you are providing a safe and reliable experience. And that is why patch testing is one of the most important steps you can take, because it clearly communicates to your client that you care about their health and well being. Performing a patch test also helps you make informed decisions on the type of products you use and what is the correct way to go with each specific situation. So remember, you must never skip a patch test for any client, especially if it is the first time that they are having a certain procedure, and if they are trying a new chemical for the first time. Therefore, make it your goal to be responsible and professional and to always prioritize the health and safety of all your clients.

8. Use precise measurements for consistent results (20 Lines - Detailed Paragraph)

Using precise measurements for all hair coloring and chemical treatments is not just a helpful practice, but a critical requirement for achieving predictable and consistent results, and it is also essential for maintaining the integrity and the safety of all chemical procedures. By using the correct tools to measure your products, you are guaranteeing that your client will get the expected color or result, while also preventing any unnecessary damage, or uneven color application that might come up when you are less careful about precision and accuracy. Precise measurements help you maintain control over chemical processes, and it also helps you make sure you are always delivering the results that you promise, while preventing any unintended outcome or damage to the hair. Therefore, mastering precise measuring is the secret ingredient to being a professional stylist that has the respect and trust of all of their clients.

This also ensures consistency, which means that if you are able to replicate your process every single time, you will always have a very dependable method, that gives you great control over your creative vision. Inaccurate measurement can also cause unwanted side effects, such as over-processing, damage, or the wrong color tone, and you will need to keep track of all your measurements, and be very precise in every action you take.

By measuring accurately you also reduce the potential for chemical burns or other adverse effects, and you are also using your products in the most optimal way, and are not losing any valuable chemical components in the process. It is a core part of the training and practice of any professional hair stylist and it is an integral part of a great skill, that will help you make all of your projects a true success. Therefore, make a commitment to always being precise, and to taking the time needed to do things right, and you will be able to deliver the most amazing styles, and also to help clients have a safe and enjoyable experience.
