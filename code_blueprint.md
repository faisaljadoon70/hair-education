# Hair Color Formulation Program Blueprint

## Overview
A comprehensive program to guide hair color formulation based on professional color theory and best practices.

## Input Parameters

### 1. Current Hair Status
- Starting level (e.g., 6.2)
- Current color tone
- Previous treatments history
- Percentage of gray hair
- Hair porosity level

### 2. Target Color
- Desired level (e.g., 4.6)
- Desired tone
- Warmth/coolness preference
- Special effects requirements

### 3. Hair Condition Factors
- Hair texture (fine, medium, coarse)
- Hair density
- Scalp condition assessment
- Previous chemical services history

## Program Logic

### 1. Level Analysis
- Calculate level difference (e.g., 6.2 to 4.6)
- Determine appropriate developer strength
- Evaluate single process possibility
- Consider lifting capacity needs

### 2. Color Theory Rules
- Identify underlying pigments present
- Calculate filling requirements
- Determine neutralizing requirements
- Factor in contributing pigment theory
- Consider color wheel relationships

### 3. Formula Generation
- Base color selection and ratios
- Toner requirements calculation
- Developer volume determination
- Processing time estimation
- Application method recommendation

## Output Components

### 1. Step-by-Step Process
- Required preliminary steps
- Detailed color formula
- Specific application technique
- Processing time guidelines
- Expected results visualization

### 2. Warnings/Alerts System
- Multiple process requirements warning
- Potential challenges identification
- Required patch testing protocols
- Critical timing considerations
- Contraindications alerts

## Feasibility Factors

### Technical Viability
1. Color theory follows specific, programmable rules
2. Formulations are based on mathematical principles
3. Decision trees are clear and definable
4. Variables are finite and measurable

### Safety Considerations
1. Built-in safety checks
2. Professional guidance disclaimers
3. Patch test requirements
4. Client history importance

## Future Enhancements
1. AI integration for pattern recognition
2. Photo analysis capabilities
3. Brand-specific formulation guides
4. Client history tracking
5. Result photo database

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Include professional override options
