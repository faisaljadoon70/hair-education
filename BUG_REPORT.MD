# Bug Report: Unexplained File Deletions in Cascade IDE

## Issue Description
Files created in the Cascade IDE are being mysteriously deleted without user intervention. This has occurred three times today with markdown (.MD) files.

## Timeline of Events

### 1. First Instance
- Created COLOR_WHEEL.MD file with database schema and implementation details
- File was visible and editable in the editor
- Upon returning later, file was gone from filesystem but still visible in editor

### 2. Second Instance
- Recreated the COLOR_WHEEL.MD file
- Added comprehensive documentation
- File disappeared again while still being shown as "open" in editor

### 3. Current Instance
- File is showing as open in editor at path:
  `C:\Users\thatc\Desktop\Faisal\Hair project\hair-education\COLOR_WHEEL.MD`
- Contains over 4000 lines of documentation
- File exists in editor but cannot be accessed through filesystem tools
- Tools report "file does not exist" despite being open and editable

## Technical Details
- IDE: Cascade (Windsurf)
- Operating System: Windows
- File Type: Markdown (.MD)
- Tools Available: view_file, edit_file, write_to_file (no delete capability)

## Concerning Factors
1. AI assistant has no programmed ability to delete files
2. Files are disappearing without user intervention
3. Editor shows files as open even after deletion
4. Content remains in editor memory but lost on filesystem
5. This creates risk of losing important documentation and code

## Impact
- Loss of valuable documentation
- Potential loss of work
- Inconsistent state between editor and filesystem
- Time wasted recreating lost files
- Risk to project integrity

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new .MD file using write_to_file tool
2. Add content to the file
3. File appears to exist and is editable in editor
4. Try to access file through filesystem tools
5. Tools report file does not exist
6. Return later to find file has been deleted from filesystem

## Current Test
This file (BUG_REPORT.MD) is being created as another test case to monitor the same behavior. Created at: 2025-02-04T03:28:30-05:00

## Additional Notes
- This appears to be a systematic issue rather than random occurrence
- Only observed with .MD files so far
- Content remains accessible in editor even after filesystem deletion
- No user intervention or delete commands involved
- Needs immediate attention from Codeium engineering team
