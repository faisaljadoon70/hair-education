Intermediate Level: "Application & Techniques"
This level is designed for individuals who have completed the Beginner Level and are ready to dive deeper into the practical aspects of hair coloring. The focus is on application techniques, formulation, and client consultation. Below is a highly detailed, expert-level breakdown of each module and topic, explained as if an expert teacher is guiding a beginner through each concept.

Module 1: Hair Analysis & Preparation
Learning Objective 1: Analyze Hair Porosity, Texture, and Condition
Expert Explanation:

Porosity: This refers to how well hair absorbs and retains moisture. There are three levels:

Low Porosity: Cuticles are tightly closed, making it hard for moisture to penetrate. Hair often resists color and takes longer to process.

Medium Porosity: Cuticles are slightly open, allowing for even color absorption and retention. This is the ideal porosity for coloring.

High Porosity: Cuticles are overly open, causing hair to absorb color quickly but also lose it fast. High porosity hair is often damaged and may need pre-treatment.

How to Test Porosity:

Float Test: Place a strand of hair in a glass of water. If it floats, it’s low porosity. If it sinks slowly, it’s medium porosity. If it sinks quickly, it’s high porosity.

Visual Aid: Use an interactive porosity test where users can "test" virtual hair strands and see the results.

Texture: This refers to the thickness of individual hair strands:

Fine: Thin strands that are delicate and can be easily damaged.

Medium: Average thickness, the most common texture.

Coarse: Thick strands that are strong but may require more processing time.

Visual Aid: Show magnified images of fine, medium, and coarse hair strands side by side.

Condition: This refers to the health of the hair:

Healthy Hair: Smooth cuticles, shiny, and elastic.

Damaged Hair: Rough cuticles, dull, and brittle.

Visual Aid: Use a checklist with images and descriptions of healthy vs. damaged hair.

Learning Objective 2: Identify Factors That Affect Color Results
Expert Explanation:

Factors Affecting Color:

Porosity: High porosity hair absorbs color quickly but may fade faster.

Previous Color: Existing color can affect how new color develops.

Hair Condition: Damaged hair may process color unevenly.

Water Quality: Hard water can leave mineral deposits that affect color.

Product Build-Up: Residue from previous products can block color absorption.

Visual Aid: Create a flowchart showing how each factor impacts color results.

Learning Objective 3: Learn to Prep Hair Before Color Applications
Expert Explanation:

Prepping Hair:

Clarify: Use a clarifying shampoo to remove product build-up.

Assess: Check porosity, texture, and condition.

Protect: Apply a barrier cream around the hairline to prevent staining.

Patch Test: Always perform a patch test to check for allergies.

Visual Aid: Show a step-by-step video of the prepping process.

Learning Objective 4: Understand General Rules for Safe Practices and How to Handle Sensitive Clients
Expert Explanation:

Safe Practices:

Gloves: Always wear gloves to protect your hands.

Ventilation: Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.

Patch Test: Always perform a patch test 24–48 hours before coloring.

Sensitive Clients: For clients with sensitive scalps, use gentle products and avoid high-volume developers.

Visual Aid: Create a checklist of safety practices with visual reminders.

Module 2: Mixing Ratios & Measurement
Learning Objective 1: Explain the Importance of Accurate Measurements
Expert Explanation:

Why Measurements Matter:

Incorrect ratios can lead to uneven color, over-processing, or under-processing.

Accurate measurements ensure consistent results and client satisfaction.

Visual Aid: Show side-by-side examples of correct vs. incorrect mixing ratios and their results.

Learning Objective 2: Understand General Mixing Ratio Guidelines
Expert Explanation:

Mixing Ratios:

Permanent Color: Typically 1:1 or 1:2 (color to developer).

Demi-Permanent Color: Usually 1:2.

Toner: Often 1:2.

Bleach: Varies based on the desired lift (e.g., 1:1.5 or 1:2).

Visual Aid: Use an interactive mixing guide where users can adjust ratios and see the results.

Learning Objective 3: Learn How to Calculate Color Mixing
Expert Explanation:

Calculating Mixes:

Example: If you need 60ml of color and the ratio is 1:1, mix 30ml of color with 30ml of developer.

Use a measuring cup or scale for precision.

Visual Aid: Provide an interactive calculator where users can input desired amounts and ratios.

Learning Objective 4: Understand the Chemical Reactions When Mixing
Expert Explanation:

Chemical Reactions:

When color and developer mix, an oxidation reaction occurs, opening the cuticle and allowing color to penetrate the cortex.

The developer’s volume determines the level of lift and processing time.

Visual Aid: Use an animated diagram to show the chemical reaction process.

Module 3: Basic Application Techniques
Learning Objective 1: Understand Best Application Practices for Different Types of Color
Expert Explanation:

Application Tips:

Permanent Color: Apply to regrowth first, then work through the ends.

Demi-Permanent Color: Apply evenly from roots to ends.

Toner: Apply to damp hair after bleaching for even results.

Visual Aid: Show step-by-step videos for each type of color application.

Learning Objective 2: Master Full Head Application, Retouch, Grey Coverage, and Color Deposit Techniques
Expert Explanation:

Full Head Application: Start at the nape, work in sections, and apply color evenly.

Retouch: Apply color only to regrowth, blending into the existing color.

Grey Coverage: Use a higher volume developer (e.g., 20-volume) for resistant grey hair.

Color Deposit: Use a lower volume developer (e.g., 10-volume) for depositing color without lift.

Visual Aid: Use an application simulator where users can practice each technique.

Learning Objective 3: Learn General Sectioning Methods
Expert Explanation:

Sectioning:

Divide hair into four quadrants: top, sides, and back.

Use clips to keep sections separate and organized.

Visual Aid: Show a diagram of sectioning with labeled quadrants.

Module 4: Client Consultation Skills
Learning Objective 1: Learn How to Effectively Communicate with Clients
Expert Explanation:

Communication Tips:

Use open-ended questions to understand the client’s goals.

Avoid technical jargon; explain concepts in simple terms.

Be honest about what is achievable.

Visual Aid: Provide a script for common consultation questions.

Learning Objective 2: Practice Asking the Right Questions to Identify Their Goals
Expert Explanation:

Key Questions:

What is your desired color?

How often do you color your hair?

Do you have any allergies or sensitivities?

Visual Aid: Create a checklist of consultation questions.

Learning Objective 3: Understand Basic Business Principles
Expert Explanation:

Business Tips:

Set clear pricing and policies.

Build a loyal client base through excellent service.

Upsell products and services when appropriate.

Visual Aid: Provide a sample pricing sheet and client agreement.

Module 5: Understanding Developer Choices
Learning Objective 1: Explain How Different Volumes of Developers Work

Developer Volumes:

10-Volume: Deposits color with no lift.

20-Volume: Lifts 1-2 levels.

30-Volume: Lifts 2-3 levels.

40-Volume: Lifts 3-4 levels (use with caution).

Visual Aid: Use an interactive chart showing developer volumes and their effects.

Learning Objective 2: Understand How Developers Impact Deposit or Lift

Deposit vs. Lift:

Lower volumes (10-20) are for depositing color.

Higher volumes (30-40) are for lifting color.

Visual Aid: Show before-and-after examples of deposit vs. lift.

Learning Objective 3: Understand the Purpose and Process of Deposit and Lift

Deposit: Adding color to the hair without lightening.

Lift: Lightening the hair by removing natural pigment.

Visual Aid: Use an animated diagram to show the deposit and lift process.

This detailed breakdown ensures intermediate learners gain a deep understanding of application techniques, formulation, and client consultation, preparing them for real-world scenarios.
