# January 29, 2025 - Authentication and Build Optimization

## Fixed Supabase Authentication and Build Issues

### Authentication Updates
1. Migrated from deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` to `@supabase/ssr`
2. Implemented complete password reset flow:
   - Server component with proper dynamic configuration
   - Client form component with OTP verification
   - Global sign out after password change
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Build Optimization
1. Fixed SWC dependency issues:
   - Added `@swc/core` and `swc-loader` to dependencies
   - Added Node.js version requirement (18.x)
   - Removed deprecated packages
   - Fixed duplicate dynamic export in reset-password page

2. Updated package.json:
   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": "18.x"
   },
   "dependencies": {
     "@swc/core": "latest",
     "swc-loader": "latest"
   }
   ```

3. Verified proper .gitignore configuration:
   - .next
   - node_modules
   - Environment files
   - Build artifacts

### Results
- Successfully deployed to Vercel with no build errors
- Password reset functionality working as expected
- Improved build performance with SWC optimizations

### Next Steps
- Monitor application performance
- Watch for any authentication-related issues
- Consider adding additional security measures if needed

## Files Affected
- src/app/page.tsx
- src/components/mobile/**
- src/styles/mobile.css

## CRITICAL MOBILE IMPLEMENTATION RULES (DO NOT BREAK THESE EVER)

### 1. NEVER TOUCH WEB FILES
- ❌ NEVER modify page.tsx files
- ❌ NEVER modify layout.tsx files
- ❌ NEVER touch ANY web files
- ❌ NEVER touch ANYTHING in src/app/

### 2. MOBILE CODE LOCATION
- ✅ ONLY create in src/components/mobile/
- ✅ Keep ALL mobile code in mobile directory
- ✅ No exceptions, ever

### 3. NO SHORTCUTS
- ❌ Don't try to "share" components
- ❌ Don't modify existing routes
- ❌ Don't touch web navigation
- ✅ Create everything new in mobile directory

### 4. TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- ✅ Web interface must work perfectly
- ✅ Mobile must be completely separate
- ✅ Test both before any changes
- ✅ Verify no web files were touched

### Recovery If Rules Are Broken
```bash
# To recover specific web files without losing mobile work:
git checkout COMMIT_HASH -- src/app/specific-page/page.tsx
```

Remember: Breaking these rules wastes hours of work and requires painful recovery processes.
