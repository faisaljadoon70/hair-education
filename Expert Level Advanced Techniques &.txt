This level is designed for individuals who have completed the Intermediate Level and are ready to master advanced techniques, color correction, and business development. Below is a highly detailed, expert-level breakdown of each module and topic, explained as if an expert teacher is guiding a learner through each concept.

Module 1: Advanced Color Formulation
Learning Objective 1: Master Generic Rules of Color Formulation for Different Scenarios

Color Formulation Basics:

Primary Colors: Red, blue, and yellow are the foundation of all hair color.

Secondary Colors: Green, orange, and purple are created by mixing primary colors.

Tertiary Colors: Colors like red-orange or blue-green are created by mixing primary and secondary colors.

Formulation Rules:

Neutralizing Unwanted Tones: Use complementary colors to cancel out unwanted tones (e.g., blue cancels orange, purple cancels yellow).

Achieving Depth: Add a darker base color to create depth.

Creating Dimension: Use multiple shades within the same color family to add dimension.

Visual Aid: Use an AI-powered color wheel where users can experiment with color combinations and see the results.

Learning Objective 2: Learn How to Analyze Underlying Pigments

Underlying Pigments: These are the natural pigments in the hair that become exposed during the lightening process.

Level 1-3: Red undertones.

Level 4-6: Red-orange undertones.

Level 7-8: Orange-yellow undertones.

Level 9-10: Yellow undertones.

How to Analyze:

Use a hair level chart to identify the natural level and underlying pigment.

Consider the client’s desired result and how the underlying pigment will affect it.

Visual Aid: Provide an interactive pigment analysis tool where users can input the hair level and see the underlying pigment.

Learning Objective 3: Understand How to Choose the Right Developer Based on the Level of Lift and Deposit Required

Developer Selection:

10-Volume Developer: Deposits color with no lift. Ideal for toning or refreshing color.

20-Volume Developer: Lifts 1-2 levels. Suitable for most permanent color applications.

30-Volume Developer: Lifts 2-3 levels. Used for significant lightening.

40-Volume Developer: Lifts 3-4 levels. Use with caution, as it can cause damage.

Visual Aid: Create an interactive chart showing developer volumes and their corresponding lift levels.

Module 2: Highlights, Lowlights & Balayage
Learning Objective 1: Master Different Sectioning Techniques

Sectioning Techniques:

Horizontal Sections: Used for traditional highlights.

Vertical Sections: Used for balayage and ombre effects.

Diagonal Sections: Used for creating movement and dimension.

Visual Aid: Show step-by-step videos of each sectioning technique.

Learning Objective 2: Understand the Principles of Highlight Placement

Highlight Placement:

Face-Framing Highlights: Brighten the face and add dimension.

Crown Highlights: Add brightness to the top of the head.

Visual Aid: Use an interactive simulation where users can practice placing highlights on a virtual model.

Learning Objective 3: Learn How to Create Seamless Balayage Effects

Balayage Technique:

Freehand Painting: Apply color with a brush, starting mid-lengths and working towards the ends.

Blending: Use a comb or brush to blend the color for a seamless transition.

Foiling: Use foils to isolate sections and create more defined highlights.

Visual Aid: Provide detailed videos and an interactive simulation for practicing balayage.

Module 3: Color Correction
Learning Objective 1: Identify Common Color Problems (Brassiness, Uneven Color, etc.)

Common Color Problems:

Brassiness: Yellow or orange tones caused by improper lightening.

Uneven Color: Patchy or inconsistent color due to uneven application.

Over-Processed Hair: Hair that is dry, brittle, and damaged from excessive coloring.

Visual Aid: Show "Before & After" examples of common color corrections.

Learning Objective 2: Develop a Plan to Fix Color Problems in Real Clients

Color Correction Plan:

Assess the Problem: Identify the issue (e.g., brassiness, uneven color).

Choose the Right Products: Select toners, color removers, or conditioners as needed.

Follow a Step-by-Step Process: Apply products in the correct order and timing.

Visual Aid: Provide an interactive troubleshooting tool where users can input the problem and receive a step-by-step solution.

Learning Objective 3: Learn How to Safely Manage Damaged Hair During the Color Correction Process

Managing Damaged Hair:

Pre-Treatment: Use protein treatments or bond builders to strengthen hair.

Gentle Products: Use low-volume developers and conditioning color products.

Post-Treatment: Apply deep conditioning treatments to restore moisture.

Visual Aid: Show a video of the entire process, from pre-treatment to post-treatment.

Module 4: Business & Client Management
Learning Objective 1: Learn Best Business Practices for Hairstylists

Business Practices:

Set Clear Policies: Establish clear pricing, cancellation, and refund policies.
